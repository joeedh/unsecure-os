
This project uses libqrencode to paint a QR code.
It is based on the Visual Studio project template for a regular 
Win32 application.  Most of the code from the template is 
unmodified.  The libqrencode library is not included.
You can download that code separately from 
http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/
Alternatively, for a Win32 port:
http://code.google.com/p/qrencode-win32/

The program paints a QR code taken from the commandline,
defaulting to "qrdemo" if no QR code was supplied.
