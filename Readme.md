Unsecure is a research project on what happens
if you write a totally unsecured OS, with no
support for virtual memory, and with everything
running in ring 0.

The name is not a joke.  Unsecure is not meant to
be used in production environments, ever.  The goal
is to probe the trade-off between performance and
security on modern hardware.
